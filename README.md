In this repository, you will find the codes for the application of deep learning models (especially neural networks) to solve different ODEs and PDEs which mainly occur in different engineering problems. The focus is mainly on solids and also the mechanics of materials at the microscale. The main theory behind this approach is based on the idea of physics-informed neural networks. The main platform to implement the routines here is the Sciann package, but certainly, the ideas can be taken to any other platforms as well.

1- How to start: a simple code for solving a first-order ODE via physics-informed neural networks. 
Further details are also provided in the Google collab. file as well as the appendix in the following article:

2- For the basic problem of mechanical equilibrium and steady-state thermal diffusion problem where we solve governing equations in a standard two-phase micro-structure see:
